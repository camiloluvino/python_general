But the scenario is even more worrying. In Chile, authority and authoritarian-
ism are usually regarded as true synonyms. One consequence, as I have just
discussed, is the idea that only authoritarianism will achieve obedience. A secondconsequence is that, due to this equivalence of terms, authority, which is anindispensable phenomenon for social coordination and the management of hier-archies in society, ends up being construed in a way that makes any exercise ofauthority intrinsically negative and undesirable. This leads to general questioningand distrust of any hierarchy and authority. Detachment is also fed by thisdisbelief. The very notion of authority ends up falling out of favor. The vicissi-tudes of political authority are also to be understood from this perspective.
Despite all these challenges, the exercise of political authority is a dimension
rarely considered by institutional politics and politicians. There are, withouta doubt, and in consideration of the above, various tasks pending in this regardfor institutional politics, especially for democratic forces. Today, democraticpolitical forces are impelled to confront the country ’s elitist, top-down, authori-
tarian, and tutelary historical tendencies and not abdicate their responsibility toexercise political authority while both challenging and resisting the idea thatonly an authoritarian form of authority is effective. This is especially importantwhen addressing the circuit of detachment. Durable political attachments andsocial regulation become more difﬁ cult in archipelago societies composed of
strengthened individuals. Authoritarianism is always a seductive alternative,even more so when those individuals are torn between their longing for auton-omy, their need for protection, and their fear of uncertainty and disorder, as isthe case in Chile.
It appears necessary to reinvent the exercise of authority in politics; detach-
ment makes doing so a political moral obligation.

Having addressed some of the most salient challenges that the circuit of detach-ment poses to politics, I conclude in the following section with some brief ﬁnal
reﬂections on the analytical scope of the concept of the circuit of detachment.
7 Final Re ﬂections
Studies of how structural changes affect individuals and societies have tended tofocus on the impact of the so-called neoliberal economic and social model. Theresults of my research have shown that the neoliberal model, while important, is notthe only structural factor to have played a signi ﬁcant role in recent decades. In the
case of Chile, and in other Latin American countries ( Domingues 2009 ;Martuccelli
2015), another important structural change is the push for democratization of social55 The Circuit of Detachment in Chile
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009310697  Published online by Cambridge University Pressrelations. The circuit of detachment is the result of the changes these two structural
factors have produced in the ordinary challenges people must face in social life andof individuals ’responses to these challenges, responses that have included mobiliz-
ing support, restructuring one ’s self-image, modifying ideals, and producing new
expectations and practices.
Recognizing that the challenges Chilean society faces result from the inter-
action of the different components of this circuit made it easier to clarifyphenomena that at ﬁrst appeared paradoxical. For example, I was able to explain
the spread of protests and mobilizations against the neoliberal model, as hashappened in Chile, not as pure resistance to the effects of a generalized neo-liberal subjugation but, rather, as itself a product of these structural currents.Moreover, this recognition allows one to understand the oscillations of theelectoral results of the last two years. These have ranged from the massive(78 percent) voter support in October 2020 for changing the constitutionpromulgated under the Pinochet dictatorship, to 44 percent of voters supportingconservative, strongly neoliberal, and authoritarian political proposals inthe second round of the most recent presidential election in December 2021.The circuit of detachment explains how it is that, while most Chileans demanda more egalitarian country, they seek to protect the bene ﬁts they have achieved,
insist that individual effort is the essential element of personal dignity, andcontinue to espouse a strong belief in the ef ﬁcacy of a “strong ”exercise of
authority.
Acknowledging the importance of the way individuals respond to structural
challenges in their everyday experiences has enabled me to reconstruct theambivalent and somehow paradoxical traits that characterize each of the cir-cuit’s components (excessiveness, disenchantment, irritation, and detachment).
It has also enabled me to avoid interpreting these processes as mere re ﬂexive
responses and to elucidate both actors ’agency and the variations in the impact
of structural traits as well as individual responses across different social groups.
Being from the popular sectors does not only de ﬁne the impact of structural
challenges (the push toward pluriactivity is bigger, to give one example) butalso de ﬁnes the sets of supports they can rely on or mobilize to face these
challenges (for example, childcare). The “new start ”modality of detachment,
which encompasses the idea of building projects and therefore requires long-term planning and plentiful resources, is scarce in these sectors. The “adversar-
ial alternatives ”modality concerns younger people. The “refuge ”modality of
detachment is a more frequent modality in this group, especially for oldergenerations. Similar differences are to be found when considering gender andgenerational criteria (space limitations reasons precluded me from givinga closer account of all these relevant nuances in this Element).56 Politics and Society in Latin America
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009310697  Published online by Cambridge University PressIn view of the above, what is the scope of an interpretation such as the one
I have proposed? If the circuit of detachment has occurred in the interaction of
speciﬁc structural currents and forms of response, must we conclude that the
circuit concept is applicable only to the case of Chile or can it be applied to
understand other contemporary societies?
The structural currents affecting Chile will not necessarily be the same as
ones operating in other societies (though they likely do operate in many other
countries). The push for the democratization of social relations, for example,
will not have as transformative and disruptive an effect in all societies as it has
had in Chile, a society historically characterized by strongly vertical social and
political bonds based on lasting and naturalized hierarchies. Although the basic
structural challenges can be similar for many societies, each country responds to
the challenges in its own way according to its distinctive characteristics and its
geopolitical position. Although all societies, and their individuals, must respond
to these challenges, not all do so in the same way because the resources,
historical inertia, or institutional design from which these responses are struc-
tured differ.
Therefore, the most useful way to approach this question may be to empiric-
ally test this interpretative framework by applying it to societies that have gone
through the so-called neoliberal moment. However, it is worth emphasizing that
there are several reasons to believe the circuit of detachment could contribute to
the understanding of very different societies. The combined stress of high social
demands and meager institutional support is revealed both in the ﬁerce forms of
competition and individual af ﬁrmation that cross social life, and in the world-
wide increased prevalence of emotional discomfort and mental illness.
Symptoms such as political disaffection appear in many societies. A general
questioning of hierarchies seems to characterize a large number of Western
societies, as shown, for example, by the increasingly fractious relationship
between citizens and police and the various irritations that this engenders.
Mistrust of institutions (science, governments, etc.) is a widespread social
trait as well as a relevant factor for the weakening and/or transformation of
the notion of truth ( McIntyre 2018 ). Individuals ’increasing tendency toward
insularity is evidenced in their withdrawal into groups of those like themselves
and in the growth of irritated, polarized, and intolerant forms of managing
differences ( Hetherington and Weiler 2009 ). The list could go on.
Thus, the scope of the circuit of detachment as an analytical tool must await
its testing via the empirical analysis of other cases. As far as Chile ’s case is
concerned, however, some brief remarks can be made on the meaning of the
above analysis for Chilean society.57 The Circuit of Detachment in Chile
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009310697  Published online by Cambridge University PressThe circuit of detachment can be read as both hopeful and worrying. It is
hopeful in that it shows Chile to be a society of individuals who recognize,across the board, the limits and costs for their own lives of the economic,developmental, social, and relational model that has governed them for thepast several decades, a society whose members are seeking political and socialsolutions. It is, at the same time, worrying because the currents that run throughChilean society are very dissimilar: while Chileans aspire to ﬁnd other ways of
living and of building selves, they also feel drawn to inhabit the margins ofsociety or to instrumentalize the situation for their own bene ﬁt, whether prag-
matically or confrontationally. It is also worrying because, for all their commit-ment to the ideal of a high-quality communal life, there are many whose deepestdesire is to live their lives at a distance from the collective, from their society, itsprinciples, promises, and norms. Finally, it is worrying because the circuit ofdetachment raises the question of how, in this context of irritation, disenchant-ment, excessiveness, and detachment, the problem of social and political regu-lation is to be solved. The social bond in Chile is under pressure to bereconstructed, which produces a high degree of uncertainty regarding the fateof the political bond.
What, then, can be said about the future? At turning points such as the one
that Chilean society now faces, social scientists have two obligations. The ﬁrst
is to try to contribute by making sense of events. The second is to recognize ourlimits because, fortunately, freedom and human agency exist, and societies arecomplex living entities that do not allow themselves to be con ﬁned. In this
Element, I have tried to ful ﬁll the ﬁrst task with humility and I close by
acknowledging the second obligation enthusiastically. The outcome remainsto be seen. The complex web we call society will determine its own destiny.58 Politics and Society in Latin America
